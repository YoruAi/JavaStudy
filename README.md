**Introduction**: This is a note about reading *Core Java (11th edition)* (written by Cay S. Horstmann).
The JDK version I am using is **JDK17**, and the IDE is IDEA. This project can be imported into **IDEA** for use.
Remember to check the option of *inheriting the project compilation output path*.

Partial code programs are only for display purposes, so their runnability cannot be guaranteed.
